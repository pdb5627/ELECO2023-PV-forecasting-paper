\section{Data Sources}
\label{sec:data-source}

The PV time series used for this analysis was the recorded output power of the rooftop PV array on the METU EEE Department machinery building.
Recordings were obtained by downloading them from the logger integrated with the inverter for the PV array.
Logged data was recorded at approximately five-minute intervals.
For the forecasting method, the logged data was aligned to exact five-minute intervals even with the hour using linear interpolation and then aggregated to hourly intervals by the mean.
For the operational model, these values were scaled to the rating of the demonstration system.


The weather forecast data used for this analysis was obtained from multiple sources.
Firstly, WRF Meteogram forecasts have been saved from the Turkish Meteorology Directorate (MGM)\cite{MGM_Meteogram}.
Since the MGM meteograms are available as a image rather than as structured data, code was developed to extract data from the plots in the meteogram and output it in csv format\cite{MeteogramExtractGithubRepo}.
Secondly, forecasts were obtained from the SolCast PV-focused weather service\cite{Solcast}.
SolCast weather forecasts include both a cloudiness forecast as well as an irradiance (ghi) forecast along with many other forecast quantities.
SolCast data is provided using an API, so no special data extraction or conversion was needed.

% OpenWeather weather service\cite{OpenWeather} was downloaded but currently is not being used.
