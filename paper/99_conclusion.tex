\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper demonstrated a novel light-weight forecasting method for PV generation suitable for application to small agricultural microgrids.
The method utilized only basic weather forecast data and did not require large computing resources.
The proposed methods were compared to each other and to a reference persistence forecast.
The proposed methods gave lower MSE compared to the persistence forecast
over a test data set of
\pdfmarkupcomment[markup=Highlight,color=yellow]{\_\_\_}{Update!} days.
Of the weather forecast sources that were compared,
\pdfmarkupcomment[markup=Highlight,color=yellow]{\_\_\_}{Update!}
obtained the lowest MSE.
Of the intra-day update methods that were compared,
\pdfmarkupcomment[markup=Highlight,color=yellow]{\_\_\_}{Update!}
obtained the lowest MSE.
