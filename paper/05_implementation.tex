\section{Implementation}
\label{sec:implementation}

The forecasting code was implemented using the Python programming language\cite{Python3}.
The Pandas\cite{Pandas} data analysis library and NumPy\cite{NumPy} were used for data manipulation.
Scikit-learn\cite{scikit-learn} was used for fitting the regression model and generating predictions from it.
Statsmodels\cite{statsmodels} was used for fitting time-series auto-regressive models and generating predictions.
Plots were generated using Matplotlib\cite{Matplotlib}.
The optimization and simulation implementation was previously described in \cite{Brown2022}.
Full implementation details can be obtained by examining the source code released on GitHub\cite{ISGT2023GithubRepo} and CodeOcean\cite{ISGT2023CodeOceanRepo}.
